- todo and bugs
    1. font-style is not very nice, but i'm really not sensitive with font-style.
    2. css structure is not brief, i have to say, as a front-end developer, css is my weakness.
    3. very confused about data flow, when i have many hierarchies, i have to transfer data from parent component?
    3. may be i can improve this lists like a dropdown list
- additional function
    1. click position checkbox, right area will show the current selection.
